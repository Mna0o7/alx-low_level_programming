What on Earth is Recursion?

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
This directory shows a roadmap I took to understanding the intricate art of recursion in C programming. 

- A function can call itself!
- Ofcourse it can. but becareful to define the exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.

Hmm interesting, don't you think. Haha not challenging at all to learn in hours. 
MURIFE DONT RUN!
